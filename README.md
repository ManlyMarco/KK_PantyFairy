# KK_PantyFairy
Plugin that adds a custom side quest and some new gameplay features to Koikatsu story mode. The side quest consists of multiple events with different tasks to do. New touch icons are added when talking to heroines in the top right corner as you progress the side quest.

This plugin is inspired by the KK_PantyRobber plugin by picolet21. He laid the groundwork for custom ADV scenes and made this plugin possible, so big kudos to him.

## How to use 
1. Make sure that you have at least [BepInEx 5.4.4](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) and [Modding API 1.18](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/KKAPI) installed.
2. Download the latest release for your game from [here](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/KK_PantyFairy/releases/latest).
3. If you have KK_PantyRobber.dll in your plugins, remove it to avoid potential compatibility issues.
4. Extract the release to your game directory. The dll file should end up inside BepInEx\plugins folder in your game's directory.
5. Start main game, either by loading an old save or starting a new game. You should see a new action icon at 1F Corridor near the Infarmary door.

## Cheats / walkthrough / spoilers
- There are some cheats you can turn on in Plugin Settings by searching for "pantyfairy" (press F1).

- To start the side quest, look on the floor of 1F Walkway around Infarmary and Library doors. After this, further events will spawn in Men's Bathroom.

- To do the second event in Locker Room it's best to advance to next period (next button at top), then press F3 to warp to Locker Room, stand in the corner, and wait for characters to come in and leave. Action icons should appear after they leave.

- To progress through the side quest and use the new powers you need to raise the red H stat bar (top right player stats). It can be done with action icons that spawn every day around the map, or with the trainer - H slider in left window (press Pause key, can be changed in plugin settings, search for 'cheattools'). Alternatively you can turn off H checks in Plugin Settings by searching for "pantyfairy".

- After finishing the side quest a new character will be added to your heroine roster. If you transfer this character out, you will need to start a new game to reset the side quest progress to get it again. You can also re-add the character by using its card available [here](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/KK_PantyFairy/blob/main/src/KK_PantyFairy/Resources/fairy_card.png).
